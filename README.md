# Coursera_CapstoneIBM_Final
A repository for holding final project of Applied Data Science Capstone coursera course

Warsaw is a 517.24 km2 capital of Poland. While it has been founded in IXth century its current urban form is a result of severe destruction during World War II (including almost complete destruction of all infrastructure on the left bank of Vistula river). As a capital city of boming economy it gorws rapidly in all direction, including suburbs with new commercial and apartment building being developed on daily basis. This poses a challange for its 1.8 mil population (and additional people migrating into Warsaw) of:

Does any of its 18 districts (boroughs) cluster - meaning that even though you like south you might consider living in the north?

The target audience is any person already living in Warsaw, who consider relocating as well as any person considering migrating into Warsaw.

I will be using Foursquare location data to determine position/ranking of the available restaurants all across Warsaw. This data will be combined with customly found data on kindergarden/preschool/high school/post high school location along with Warsaw theaters position to allow for better district clustering (and help author of this notebook find his place to live).

Author Note: Naturally much of the data used will have Polish elements, which author tried to translate into English as much as he could, but some challanges may arise.
